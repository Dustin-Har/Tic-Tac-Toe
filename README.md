### Overview

-   Who doesn't like the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. I have made the game Tic-Tac-Toe on the conputer. You have the ability to play with a friend on the same computer
-   and try to beat them by getting three tokens in a row. You can either be the worm or its prey, a bird. The game will keep track of how many wins each person has.

### How To


### Player 1(worm) will start the game first when page loads.
